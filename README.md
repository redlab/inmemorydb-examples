===================

An example setup of testing with Spring, Hibernate, JUnit,H2 database

This example started long time ago with Spring 3 and Hibernate 4. Now many years later, 
we have Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA which sets up everything for you and makes things easier.

I updated my old example to Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA. See [HELP.md](HELP.md) for links to used frameworks.

Note: you can still find the old on in old-hibernate4 branch.

Updates
===================
* 2022-06-10 Use latest spring boot and data jpa. Oh yes, and Java 17
