inmemorydb-examples
===================

An example setup of testing with Spring, Hibernate, JUnit, Unitils and H2 database

This Example uses Hibernate 4, Spring 3.2.1, Unitils 3.3, Junit 4 and a H2 Database to perform unit tests on a database layer.

Most of the config can probably be reused in your own project.

Update 
===================
Unitils 3 isn't working with Hibernate higher then 4.2 :-( or at least, I could get it to work yet.
