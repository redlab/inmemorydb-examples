**Warning** this is a bit outdated and from the pre Spring Boot Starters area. This kind of setup is now almost automagically supported by Spring Data & Spring Boot Starters.

===================

An example setup of testing with Spring, Hibernate, JUnit, Unitils and H2 database

This Example uses Hibernate 4, Spring 4.x, Unitils 3.3, Junit 4 and a H2 Database to perform unit tests on a database layer.

Most of the config can probably be reused in your own project.

Update 
===================
Unitils 3 isn't working with Hibernate higher then 4.2 :-( or at least, I couldn't spend the time to get it to work yet.
